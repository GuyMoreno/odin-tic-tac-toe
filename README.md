# odin-tic-tac-toe
I’m building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript. The goal is to organize everything so it’s easy to manage, keeping things like the gameboard, players, and game flow in their own neat sections. I’ll focus on using factories to avoid too much global code.

## What I’ll Do
- Gameboard: I’ll store the gameboard as an array inside a Gameboard object.
- Players: I’ll create player objects to keep track of their moves.
- Game Controller: I’ll make an object to handle the flow of the game and check for winners or ties.
- Display: Once the game works in the console, I’ll add a way to show the gameboard on a webpage so players can interact with it.
Steps
- Start with the Logic: I’ll first get the game working in the console. No HTML or CSS needed yet—I’ll focus on getting the game to check for a winner and ties.
- Keep it Clean: I’ll use factories to organize the gameboard, players, and display, keeping everything in its own little world.
- Add the Display: Once the game logic is solid, I’ll add a display to show the game on the webpage and let players click to make their moves.
- User Features: I’ll make it so players can enter their names, add a restart button, and see the results when the game ends.
## Tips for myself
- I’ll focus on the game logic first—making sure everything works in the console—before worrying about how it looks on the page.
- The HTML/CSS stuff can come later. 
The most important thing is making the game function smoothly first.
